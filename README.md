## using Convolutional neural network 
### What is Convolutional neural network?
CNN is a representative algorithm of deep learning, which is a class of feedforward neural networks that includes convolutional computation and has a deep structure.
A typical CNN is composed of 3 partsï¼š
  * Convolutional layers
  Responsible for extracting local features in the image.

  This process could be understood as using a filter (the kernel) to filter individual small regions of the image, and get the feature values of these       small regions.
 * Pooling layers
 * Fully connected layers
### Why use Convolutional neural network?
CNN is the best at image processing, it can:
  1. effectively downscale large data volume into small data volume
  2. effectively retain image features, in line with the principle of image processing
